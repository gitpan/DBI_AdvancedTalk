<LI><H2>Some key points
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Only profiles ‘top level’ calls from application, not ‘recursive’ calls from within DBI/DBD.
<LI>Timing data is collected and merged into a $h-&#062{Profile}{…}{…} data tree
<LI>All handles share the same data tree by default - giving one overall set of results
<LI>The ‘path’ through the tree to where the data is merged-in can be dynamically controlled
<LI>By default $dbh method calls are usually associated with the $dbh-&#062{Statement} string
<LI>DBI::Profile can be subclassed (e.g., DBI::ProfileDumper for mod_perl)
<LI>Applications can add their own timing data
<LI>More features than I can fit on the slide...
