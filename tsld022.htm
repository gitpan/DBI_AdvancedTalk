 <H1>Optimizing Perl - Some Tips</H1> 
 <P><UL>
<LI><H2>Perl is fast, but not that fast...
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>Still need to take care with apparently simple things in 'hot' code
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Function/method calls have 'significant' overheads per call.
<LI>Copying data also isn't cheap, especially long strings (allocate and copy)
<LI>Perl compiles to 'op codes' then executes them in a loop...
<LI>The more ops, the slower the code (all else being roughly equal).
<LI>Try to do more with fewer ops. Especially if you can move loops into ops.
</UL></UL><UL>
<LI><H2>Key techniques include:
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Caching at many levels, from common sub-expression elimination to web caching
<LI>Functional programming: @result = map { … } grep { … } @data; 
</UL></UL><UL>
<LI><H2>But don't get carried away... only optimize hot code, and only if needed
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Don't optimize for performance at the cost of maintenance. Learn perl idioms.
